### Construct Linear Regression Model for Prediciton 

#### Introduction
Given a set of data points with at least one predictor and one continuous response variable, we want to construct a linear model to predict the response.  This is the aim of Linear Regression, which is a supervised learning technique.
In the context of this assignment, data is collected from 35 staff employed in a pharmaceutical company.  The data can be found in the file salary.xlsx.  The following table lists the variables used in the file and their descriptions:


| Variable |       	Description                           |
|--------- |--------------------------------------------- |
| salary   |Salary in dollars per hour earned by staff    |
| years	   |Number of years staff has been with company   |
| gender   |1 = male, 0 = female                          |

The response variable is salary, and the predictors are years and gender.
Use pandas.read_excel to extract the data from salary.xlsx into a dataframe.
